If a module is not saving it's settings, delete it's module file in GameSense > Modules > ModuleName.json!
To make sure that the config saves after doing a lot of changes, type "-saveconfig"!
To back the config up in a zip file type "-backupconfig"!
Try to make as many changes to the config in game, directly modifying the config sometimes can break it
