Installation:
1) GameSense requires Minecraft Forge to run! If you don't have Forge installed, you need to download the installer here: 

https://files.minecraftforge.net/maven/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.12.2.html
2) Download the GameSense jar from the releases channel on Discord or Github. Drag this jar into your mods folder located in %appdata%/.minecraft/mods/1.12.2. If these folders do not exist, make them.
3) Run Minecraft using your forge profile and GameSense will load in with it. You can check that it is loaded by clicking on the "Mods" button in the home screen.

FAQ:*
1) My ClickGui looks HUGE!!!

-The ClickGui scales with the other game Guis, so adjust your gui scale to "normal" in the game options.

2) GameSense won't load!

-GameSense utilizes mixins (which is how we modify/interact with some minecraft code), which means the client can be incompatible with others.

Known compatibility issues: Impact, Phobos

Compatible with: Future, Salhack, Pyro, ForgeHax, Seppuku, Wurst 2+

3) How do I start the RPC?

-The RPC by default is not enabled, to start it turn on the module "DiscordRPC" in the MISC category.
