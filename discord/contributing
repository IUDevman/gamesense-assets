If you are interested in contributing, feel free to download the source from the github and make a pull request. We'll try to look at it as soon as possible.

Stylistic Notes:
1) Module names do not have any spaces and each word is capitalized. EX: ModuleManager, AutoCrystal, SelfTrap.

2) Setting names are capitalized, but have spacing in them for the "display" name. The config name is the same, but without spaces. EX: "Cancel Crystal", "Blocks Per Tick".

3) Smaller features that are similar are usually combined into one module such as PlayerTweaks or RenderTweaks.

Contributing Goals:
General:
1) All code contributed should be original/properly credited (try for original).
2) Please explain why your changes would benefit the client.
3) Try to make pull requests for 1 or 2 new features- big pull requests are hard to look through and accept without a lot of changes.
